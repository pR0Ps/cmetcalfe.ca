    <h1><a href="../../blog/recovering-data-off-a-bootlooping-nexus5.html">Recovering data off a bootlooping Nexus 5</a></h1>
  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <h2>The situation</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_5">Nexus 5</a> that I've had for almost 5 years started bootlooping repeatedly.</p>
<p>I've replaced/repaired multiple parts of it over the years but lately it had been more flaky than
usual. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes when booting it would show a "Firmware update in progress, don't disconnect your
   computer" message, even though there was nothing connected to the USB port.</li>
<li>It would randomly freeze and soft reboot when using it about once a week.</li>
<li>When propping it up on a book or something to angle the screen towards me, the screen would
   sometimes turn off and on (as it turns out, this was a warning sign)</li>
</ul>
<p>I've been ready to replace it for a while, but couldn't justify it while this one was perfectly (ok,
mostly) functional. That changed today when I tried to turn it on and it started bootlooping.</p>
<p>So buy a new phone and move on, right? Right, except I committed the cardinal sin of living in the
digital age - not having complete backups. Yeah, yeah, I know.</p>
<p>I got most of it. I'd been using <a href="https://github.com/pR0Ps/freeotp-export">Syncthing</a> to automatically back up photos, videos, and other
files to my home server every night so they were all good. The problem was that I had been using
<a href="https://github.com/pR0Ps/freeotp-export">FreeOTP-export</a> to back up my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">2FA</a> secrets manually and the latest backup was missing a bunch
of logins.</p>
<p>So I needed to somehow get into my non-booting phone and pull the data off it. At least because I
was replacing it, all destructive options were on the table.</p>
<h2>Diagnosis</h2>
<p>The first step was seeing if other people had this problem. Some searching revealed that it was most
likely the power button gone bad and being stuck in the pressed position.</p>
<p>To confirm this, I rapidly hammered the power button on a hard surface while booting, hoping that
the jarring would un-stick it and let it boot. This sort of worked in that it would boot, but
stopping at any point would result it it powering off again. It was also extremely difficult to tap
it consistently enough to keep the phone on for long enough to pull any data off it.</p>
<p>The issue I mentioned earlier where propping the phone up made the screen turn on and off now made sense.
I'm guessing this was causing a slight flexing of the power button switch, causing it to close and
trigger. Over time this must've permanently bent something so it stayed closed, causing the
bootloop.</p>
<p>Now that I had pretty much confirmed that it was something physically wrong with the power button
circuitry, I messaged my friend <a href="https://mremallin.ca/">Mike</a>. When it comes to electronics, he's definitely more
experienced than me. Plus, he lets me borrow his tools :)</p>
<h2>The "fix"</h2>
<p>The next day Mike came over with his soldering iron and we started brainstorming.</p>
<p>The plan of attack was to just take the power button off the board entirely. It can't always be
pressed down if it's not on the board right?</p>
<p>In preparation for this, I wanted the phone to automatically boot when it was plugged into a charger
so I wouldn't have to manually short the pins on the board. Fortunately this can be done with a
fastboot command: <code>fastboot oem off-mode-charge 0</code> (basically: don't allow charging while off,
therefore turn on when charging).</p>
<p>After desoldering the power button from the main board, it was still bootlooping. Not good. I went
back and cleaned up the solder to make absolutely sure that the power button signal pins weren't
connected in any way. Still bootlooping when powered on. It would get to the bootloader and stay
there, meaning the power button wasn't being pressed anymore, but when launching to either recovery
or the main OS, it would immediately restart.</p>
<p>Looked into dumping data from the bootloader - impossible.</p>
<p>Reflashed the boot and recovery partitions - same thing.</p>
<p>Tried booting into recovery using <code>fastboot boot &lt;recovery-image&gt;</code> - bootloop.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sounds like it's time to cry</p>
<p>-- Someone on <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#lineageos-dev">Freenode's #lineageos-dev channel</a> after I explained the situation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thankfully, it was not. Right after that, someone else asked if I had reconnected the battery. I had
not.</p>
<p>Turns out that a working battery is required to boot the phone, even when it's plugged in. I had
taken the battery out to desolder the power button and never put it back in since the phone seemed
to boot fine without it. Whoops.</p>
<p>After plugging the battery into the board and booting the phone, it launched the main OS without any
issues. Huge relief.</p>
<h2>Recovering the data</h2>
<p>With the phone booted up normally I used <code>adb</code> (running as root) to pull the 2FA codes and
other important things that I knew I needed over to my laptop.</p>
<p>I really don't trust myself to remember everything so I booted the phone into recovery mode and
pulled a complete backup of <code>/data/data</code>, <code>/data/app</code>, and <code>/storage/sdcard</code> (<a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#filesExternal">not actually an
sdcard</a>) to my laptop as well.</p>
<p>To make <strong>absolutely</strong> sure I didn't miss anything, I also pulled a raw image of the entire flash
memory (disk-based encryption was not enabled) using <code>adb pull /dev/block/mmcblk0 mmcblk0.img</code>.
Everything I need should be in the normal backups, but if not, I can always go spelunking through
that image.</p>
<h2>Lessons learned</h2>
<ul>
<li>If it's important, back it up <em>automatically</em>. If it's not automatic, at some point it will be
   missed.</li>
<li>Make sure you have the ability to get root access on every device you own before you need it - in
   this case I wouldn't've been able to pull the 2FA codes or do full backups without it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Future plans</h2>
<p>For the Nexus 5, I'm planning on either buying a replacement power button or maybe just soldering
some wires to the exposed pads and snaking them out of the phone to an external button if I can't
find one. The phone can then continue to be used as an app development testbed, a <a href="https://store.google.com/product/chromecast">Chromecast</a>
remote, or as a <a href="../../blog/adding-xbox360-controller-support-to-a-nexus5.html">basic emulation console</a> until it dies for real. In theory I could keep using it
as a phone too, but at this point I just don't trust it enough.</p>
<p>For my next phone, I've decided on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Xperia_XZ1_Compact">Xperia XZ1 Compact</a>. It's a smaller phone that's mostly
waterproof (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code">IP68</a>), has a fast SoC (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Qualcomm_Snapdragon_systems-on-chip#Snapdragon_835_and_845_(2017/18)">Snapdragon 835</a>), a headphone jack, SD card support, and
great battery life. I have high hopes for it. Also, as evidenced by this post, having root access to
the OS is pretty critical at times so I'll be flashing <a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a> on it ASAP.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Update</p>
<p>CyanogenMod has effectively been replaced by <a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a>. The links in this article originally
all pointed to CyanogenMod but since it no longer exists, I've updated them to use the LineageOS
equivilents where possible. The instructions will also need to be slightly modified for use with
LineageOS builds.</p>
</div>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I finally just bought a new phone (a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_5">Nexus 5</a>), and after flashing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyanogenMod">CyanogenMod</a> onto it, I've
been messing around with its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go">OTG</a> support. My old phone (a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_4">Nexus 4</a>) <a href="http://blog.gsmarena.com/nexus-4-does-not-support-usb-otg-despite-google-saying-otherwise/">didn't have the
capability</a> so being able to plug in keyboards, mice, external hard drives, and various other
peripherals was (embarrassingly enough) a thrill.</p>
<p>Keyboards worked, mice worked, but when an Xbox 360 controller was plugged in, nothing happened.
Turns out that while the kernel didn't have support for it enabled out of the box, getting it
enabled and pushing the change upstream into the CyanogenMod project was easier than I thought.</p>
<p>Beware that this post is going to be more of a record of what I did so that I can do it again and
less of a coherent tutorial.</p>
<h2>Building CyanogenMod</h2>
<p>First step was to download and compile CyanogenMod for my phone. I'm not going to go into this in
any detail on this because there's already a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161224200646/https://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Development">good overview</a> on the CyanogenMod wiki that covers
the entire process, as well as a <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/hammerhead/build">customized guide for the Nexus 5</a>. If those articles are
followed correctly, you should be able to build a fresh CyanogenMod image with:</p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>brunch hammerhead
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<h2>Enabling the kernel module</h2>
<p>Once the image was flashed to the phone and verified to be working, the next step was to enable the
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.16/input/devices/xpad.html">xpad kernel module</a>.</p>
<p>Copy current kernel config to the kernel directory for editing:</p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">cd</span> &lt;build dir&gt;/kernel/lge/hammerhead/
cp arch/arm/configs/cyanogenmod_hammerhead_defconfig .config
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Edit the config:</p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>make menuconfig <span class="nv">ARCH</span><span class="o">=</span>arm
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>At this point, a menu will come up. Search for <code>xpad</code> (type <code>/xpad</code>), and take note of the paths.
<code>ESC</code> out of the search, navigate the tree and enable the modules found with the search. Save and
exit.</p>
<p>Copy the config back and clean up any stray <code>*.o</code> files:</p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>cp .config arch/arm/configs/cyanogenmod_hammerhead_defconfig
make mrproper
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>After enabling the module, rebuild CyanogenMod using the normal <code>brunch hammerhead</code> and flash it to
the phone.</p>
<h2>Submitting the change upstream</h2>
<p>Since Xbox controller support had already been requested in <del><a href="https://jira.cyanogenmod.org/browse/CYAN-4469">a JIRA ticket</a></del>(dead link), I went
through the process to submit <a href="https://review.lineageos.org/#/c/LineageOS/android_kernel_lge_hammerhead/+/87409/">the change</a> on the CyanogenMod Gerrit instance for inclusion in the
next release. There's a guide for this <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/submitting-patch-howto.html">here</a>. As well as the guide, I found the people in
<a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#cyanogenmod-dev">#cyanogenmod-dev on Freenode</a> to be very helpful.</p>
<p>A short while after submitting <a href="https://review.lineageos.org/#/c/LineageOS/android_kernel_lge_hammerhead/+/87409/">the change</a> to Gerrit, it was merged into the <code>cm-11.0</code> branch as
commit <a href="https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_lge_hammerhead/commit/7ef4f6a87cc114b5010b623d72840b1d38ea01ed"><code>i7ef4f6a</code></a> and pushed out in the next nightly build (<a href="../../images/cyanogenmod-changelog-xbox-support.png">changelog screenshot</a>).</p>
<h2>Wrap-up</h2>
<p>It feels great to be able to contribute to an amazing open source project that had <a href="https://twitter.com/CyanogenMod/status/157378138802888704">at least a
million people</a> using it at one point or another. I recognize that the change by itself was just
changing a config file to enable functionality that already existed, but it's helped me get through
some of the non-coding hurdles of contributing to an Android fork like CyanogenMod (adb, fastboot,
unlocking and rooting phones, compiling AOSP, flashing images, the contribution process, etc). This
time the actual contribution itself was minor, but it's gotten me more familier with the process,
hopefully making it easier to contribute something more substantial in the future.</p>
<p>In the end, I learned a lot about Android development and how all the different pieces that I had
read about at one point or another actually fit together. During the whole process I also lost a lot
of the fear I had about messing with phones and other more expensive locked down devices. Going
forward, I'm going to attempt to compile and flash open source operating systems like CyanogenMod
onto more devices that I own. I like being able to tweak things and feel like I really own them,
hardware and software.</p>

    <h1><a href="../../blog/fixing-save-corruption-ridiculous-fishing.html">Fixing save file corruption in Ridiculous Fishing</a></h1>
  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vlambeer.RidiculousFishing">Ridiculous Fishing</a> is a game by <a href="http://www.vlambeer.com/">Vlambeer</a> about fishing. That's if you
can call chainsawing fish and blowing them out of the sky with a bazooka "fishing".</p>
<p>I've been playing this game on and off for a while now, but just recently I had
a problem where my save file somehow got corrupted, making the app refuse to open.</p>
<p>The problem first manifested as the game freezing for up to 5 seconds when
navigating around the UI or buying items in the in-game store. Since I was
running the game on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_5">Nexus 5</a> (not the latest and greatest, but pretty
close), it seemed weird. The delay got longer and longer until the game
eventually crashed and refused to reopen.</p>
<p>Since I was pretty far into the game (I only needed to catch one more species
of fish!), I opted to try to fix it instead of just wiping the app's data and
starting again. I initially tried clearing the app's cache and
<a href="../../blog/reinstall-android-app-without-losing-data.html">reinstalling the app</a>, but the problem persisted.</p>
<p>The next step was to dump the games's data to my computer so I could do some
analysis on it. Some exploration on the device revealed that the settings and
data were stored in the folder <code>/data/data/com.vlambeer.RidiculousFishing.humble</code>
(I have the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble Bundle</a> version of the app).</p>
<p>To pull that folder to my current directory, I used <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html">ADB</a>:</p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>adb root <span class="c1">#Restart adbd on the device with root permissions</span>
adb pull /data/data/com.vlambeer.RidiculousFishing.humble/
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>A quick <code>du -h</code> revealed that something was very wrong in the
<code>files/Library/Preferences/com.vlambeer.RidiculousFishing.humble.plist</code> file.
It should've been just a text document, but was well over 200MB.</p>
<p>After trying out of habit to open the file in <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and having it hang (oops),
I paged through the document with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less_%28Unix%29">less</a>. About halfway through the file,
there was a line containing <code>&amp;amp;lt;message&amp;amp;gt;@eggbirdTBA Take it to the
Smartypants Bar</code> (no, that's not a formatting error, in the plist there's XML
data stored in a <code>&lt;string&gt;</code> element, requiring the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> characters to be
escaped) followed by about 200MB of garbage.</p>
<p>Apparently there are <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/908575/how-to-edit-multi-gigabyte-text-files-vim-doesnt-work">ways to load huge files in Vim</a>, as well as other text
editors that handle them nicely, but since I already knew what line was causing
the issue, a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed">sed</a> command would do the trick.</p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sed <span class="s1">&#39;/Take it to the Smartypants Bar/d&#39;</span> com.vlambeer.RidiculousFishing.humble.plist &gt; temp.plist
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Total size of <code>temp.plist</code>: 107.11KB. Much better.</p>
<p>After going though and deleting some lines around the one that was removed (to
make the XML valid again), I pushed the file back to the device:</p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>adb push temp.plist /data/data/com.vlambeer.RidiculousFishing.humble/files/Library/Preferences/com.vlambeer.RidiculousFishing.humble.plist
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Success! The game opened properly, all the freezing issues were gone, and my
save data was still there.</p>
